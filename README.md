# Tetris_game

**1. Introduction**
The aim of the project was to create an interactive application using a screen monitor, keyboard and mouse to communicate with the operator. We decided
implement the classic Tetris game.


**2. Description of graphic elements**
The game board is represented by a two-dimensional array of the **bool[**] type with constants
dimensions:

The game window contains interactive elements such as control buttons, score labels, number of rows cleared and level.
The interface responds to keyboard events (control buttons) and refreshes itself
responses to game state changes:
